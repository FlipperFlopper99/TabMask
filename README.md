<h2 align="center">Tutorial - How to run and tips</h2>

To run TabMask, you don't have to download or code anything. You only have to drag a button to an empty area on your bookmarks bar.

Since the button cannot be hosted on GitHub, you can find it on [this site](https://1728.saraw25307.repl.co).

__If that site is blocked__, you can try going to one of these:

[1](https://1728.saraw25307.repl.co), [2](https://1728.saraw25307.repl.co), 

To run TabMask, click on the bookmark that was created, and then select one of the presets to disguise your tab as an educational/school website.
